##Â Background

Gentrification is the process of changing the character of a neighbourhood through the influx of more affluent residents and businesses. Although at first glance it seems very positive, it is actually a controversial topic in politics and urban planning. It is unquestionable that a neighbourhood can benefit from physical improvements of its buildings or the creation of new business; however, gentrification normally comes at the price of the displacement (or replacement) of the working-class population by the new middle class as the cost of living in the area tends to increase.

## Problem statement

Our goal was to use census data for every tract in the New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in order to discover and analyze patterns related to the gentrification process.

We were allowed to formulate our own question and we decided to study the possibility of Investment without displacement and therefore the factors that enable it.

## The Submissions

The submissions consist of 3 documents: A project report, and Datafolio, and the code. 

- The Project Reprot shows the rationale behind our analyses, our observations and conclusions.
- The Datafolio summarises our finding in a visually impactful way
- The code shows the precise content of our analysis. Of the 3 documents it is frankly the least important.
